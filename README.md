-- THIS IS A SCHOOL PROJECT --

1. This is NOT an offical redesign of the Chruch of Satan website
2. This IS to use the skills learned on my first semester for Mulitmedia Design Education.
3. If this is found by an active Member of the Church of satan and want to discuss anything regarding it, please do contact me.
4. If you are are higher ranking member and want it removed, please contact me regarding this matter too.

ChurchofSatan.com was chosen because I had a great idea to make it stand out from the crowd and use the religions values for a design. Any art used to decorate on the site is made by me. 
Some pictures, might have be pulled from the original website to make it look more official and give it proper content instead of mindless filler. 
The website is made only with HTML and CSS. I wish to give it more function and responsiveness if I work on it in the future.
